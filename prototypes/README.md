# Prototypes

This folder holds early-stage prototypes and proof-of-concept implementations. Each prototype is an initial version of a concept or functionality that may be expanded upon in future projects.

## Contents

Each prototype will be stored in its own folder, with documentation explaining the idea, functionality, and potential use cases.
